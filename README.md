# igi1conv — Project IGI 1 Game Converter

![Project IGI 1 banner](assets/01_header.png)

This is a standalone command-line converter and inspector for *Project IGI 1* game files. Inspired by the original IGI1Conv shipped with IGI 2, it allows you to seamlessly read, convert, and inspec[...]

It's the ultimate tool for modders and researchers looking to extract game assets, modify them using modern tools, and inject them back into the game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use **Apply Textures** on 3D models in the GUI, you must first select the active level folder from the **Settings** menu to resolve the correct texture mappings.

> **AI Models / Characters Support**: As of v1.7.0, AI character bone models, parsing (DNER), and textures (including upside-down mapping fixes) are now fully supported.

> [!NOTE]
> **v1.7.0 Updates**: 
> - The GUI "Export to Obj" now intuitively prompts for a destination folder when exporting both **binary** and **ASCII/text** `MEF/MEX` models. All textures and `.mtl` materials are generated in [...]
> - **Recursive ATTA Support**: Both "Export to Obj" and "Build Rigid Model" now walk the full attachment hierarchy, merging all sub-models and resolving their textures automatically from the leve[...]
> - **Fixed Bone Model Rendering**: Character bone models (type1) now render correctly in the GUI with proper world-space positioning.

## 🐚 CLI Version (Command-Line Interface)

A lightweight, high-performance command-line utility optimized for scripting, automated builds, and batch tasks:

*   **Asset Extraction**: Unpack and pack `.res` archives.
*   **Mesh Conversion**: Export proprietary `.mef` models directly to standard `.obj` files.
*   **Texture Conversion**: Convert images to and from `.tex`, `.spr`, and `.pic` formats (with resizing).
*   **Script Decompilation**: Decompile `.qvm` bytecode to `.qsc` source, and compile `.qsc` back to `.qvm`.
*   **Metadata Editing**: Export `.dat` mappings to JSON and compile them back into binary `.dat`/`.mtp` packages.
*   **Batch Operations**: Recursively process entire folders of assets in one command.

### CLI Usage & Commands

Below are practical, real-world examples showing how to leverage the `igi1conv` CLI to mod Project IGI 1 assets:

#### 1. Working with Textures (`.tex`, `.spr`, `.pic`)
The game stores textures in a proprietary format. You can export them to `.png` to edit them, and then repack them.
```bash
# Get information about a texture (dimensions, mipmaps, mode)
igi1conv tex info textures/FLARE00.TEX

# Export a texture to PNG for editing
igi1conv tex to-png textures/FLARE00.TEX -o my_edits/FLARE00.png

# Resize and export simultaneously
igi1conv tex to-png textures/arrow1_1.spr -o out/arrow1_1.png --resize 32 32

# Convert your edited PNG back to the game's TEX format
igi1conv tex to-tga my_edits/FLARE00.png -o textures/FLARE00.TEX
```

#### 2. Exporting 3D Meshes (`.mef`)
Extract weapons, characters, or level geometry into `.obj` format.
```bash
# Dump the structural data of a mesh to a text file for inspection
igi1conv mef dump models/model1.mef -o model1_struct.txt

# Export a single model to OBJ
igi1conv mef export models/model1.mef -o model1.obj

# Export all models in a folder iteratively (Batch Mode)
igi1conv mef export models/weapons/ -o output_objs/ --batch

# Bundle a MEF with its actual textures (requires the map's .dat file
